## RecipeHub


###  A Web Application for the storage of recipes 

Are you tired of having your favourite recipes strewn across various websites and cookbooks?

RecipeHub is an extremely easy to use web application which allows members to submit their favourite recipes, along with storing them in one spot.
Users can upload photos, assign dietary categories, and browse the submissions of other members. 
A fluid semantic UI experience allows users to navigate throughout the application in just a few clicks of a mouse.

RecipeHub is a node js webapp which is built using a Hapi server, Handlebars framework and Mongo database. Images are dynamically handled by an intuitive Cloudinary plugin.
